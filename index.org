** On a plane <2015-03-12 Thu>
   We are having a bit of trouble with the environment and def!. Able
   to sucessfully set a key value pair, but the state
   disappears. Definitely have a problem with the context. Need to
   investigate more. I think the next step is setting up a functional
   test harness to ensure we aren't breaking things, then we can go
   back and do some refactoring to get the environment issues squared
   away.
